Parse Meta data 
    Read missing variable file
    Get a list of groups    
    For each group 
        Get information like label and variable name about specific group which are present in norway.   
        Generate a summary: How many variables are in each group 

[9:10 AM, 11/20/2025] Bri: would be nice to plot it in a figure, bar chart

you can now work towards the distribution of values (from the dataset files) for each variables that are in norway - Today 20 Nov

spend some time to undersand the code and comment what you understand on each line is doing ( you can also tweak some parameters to see what changes) 20 Nov

also summarize the appraoch (so you learn how to design code, like in words): for example first step is defining the file names ina good way, 2nd step is reading some meta files. like general steps that translates to code - Over the period of three to 4 days. Not the main aim but comes with the practice


26.11: 6 hours
Read more about functions - 10 min
ALWAYS check which branch are working on.
Always plot and save results in results folder
Modify the code to plot only those variables which are available in Norway
Change the plot title to description (variable name), to have both of it
Find the description of the codes (., 1, 2)


For github*
1) Fetch origin
2) Check the files that are changed
3) Describe commit and add description
4) Push to branch


04.12.25
For python: try to read and understand the code i did yesterday, and save the figures in a folder.
Practice some functions, create 5 small functions, with multiple parameters, default value, default data type, and return some values. Learn how to define function, how to call them etc
